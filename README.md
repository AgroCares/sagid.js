## What is a SAGID?
With a SAGID it is possible to identify products that are used in the agricultural sector to improve the soil chemically, physically and biologically. For example fertilizers, manure, plant residues, soil improvers etc. One of the main benefits of SAGID is that users can create unique ID's for their products by themselves without the need of a central repository. Other users can  then easily integrate new products in their systems as the SAGID already includes key information about the product, like:
* Producer
* Country of producer
* Source
* Form
* Treatment
* Content, for example:
  * Nitrogen
  * Phosphate
  * Effective organic matter
  * etc.
